# Interactive 2D Ising Model (Marimo)

This project provides an **interactive simulation of the 2D Ising model** using [Marimo](https://marimo.io).  
You can adjust parameters such as lattice size, temperature, and number of sweeps, and visualize spin configurations, magnetization, and system evolution.

## ðŸ”§ Installation (with uv)

I recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, isolated Python environments.

```bash
uv run marimo run Ising.py
```
